# OCA-NET

OCA-NET: A Physical Information Neural Network to Solve Acoustic Wave Equation and Its Inverse Problem

The code in this repository is a preliminary version, used only to illustrate the principles, and a more complete version will be put together after the paper is published. Any questions about the code can be directed to 1063064604@qq.com.

Special thanks are due to the following work, on the basis of which we have improved the structure.
